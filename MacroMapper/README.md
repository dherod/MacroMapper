# MacroMapper: Visual Studio 2012 Extensibility project written in CSharp

Visual Studio 2012 no longer has the Macro functionality that was available in previous versions.
This creates a loadable Add-in that maps Macro functionality so that it can be easily bound to the TOOLS toolbar or Keyboard shortcuts.
